# Faiss Demos for Pascal (Delphi and Lazarus)

This repository contains demos showcasing various functionalities of Faiss, a
library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. These
demos are adapted for use in Pascal, specifically for Delphi and Lazarus
environments.

To utilize the original Faiss library within Pascal, a Pascal wrapper must be
obtained from [the BuyLibs website](https://buylibs.com/pascal/faiss). This
wrapper facilitates the integration of Faiss functionalities into Pascal
projects.
